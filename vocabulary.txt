The enfeeblement of mathematical skill
We look for deeds not words
All you will need is a large sheet of paper, and fairly decent handwriting in order to evaluate horrendous-looking sums and to discover subtle patterns in data
One of the main objectives of this book is to explain how a person can solve recurrences without being clairvoyant

Exercise 3 illustrates this with a vengeance
Such programs are indispensable, especially for people who need to deal with large formulas (незаменимы)

His bizarre [ба'заа] disguise drew stares from fellow shoppers
Rosie had replied in a mumble
In case of ties ...
Now let's plunge in and really immerse ourselves in the subject
Moreover, 'm\n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio.
We have designed this book to be both versatile and complete.
You can consider this book to be a УbuffetФ ['бууфей] or УsmorgasbordФ from which you can pick and choose the material that best supports the course you wish to teach
This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools.
Which algorithm is best for a given application depends on the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted
An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output
Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous [ub'iquitous] (ever-present) and include the following examples ...
These lists are far from exhaustive (as you again have probably surmised from this bookТs heft).
Such ambitious questions have long tantalized the world's best thinkers
This problem is the well-known Уtraveling-salesman problem,Ф and it is NP-complete.
For many years, we could count on processor clock speeds increasing at a steady rate.
In order to elicit (achieve) the best performance from multicore computers, we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind
The event was recorded by a contemporary historian (современником событи€)
Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers.
At larger problem sizes the differences in efficiency between algorithms become particularly prominent (known, famous).
Issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored in order to convey (transmit) the essence of the algorithm more concisely (shortly).
The remaining subarray corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table
A false seam sewn [cеун] into the back of a seamless stocking
The implication is that no one person at the bank is responsible
At each vertex we consider the angles formed on the adjacent faces at that corner
This is highly sophisticated computer system
He will be forever immortalized in the history books
She pushed the bike up the steep hill
Umami is a category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate.
I like salad with sour cranberries with sweet beet
He pigeonholed his charts and notes
We prefer not to get bogged down in such formalism, and so we rely on our informal analysis to show that the second property holds for the outer loop
Indentation indicates block structure.
Then the notation x.f.g is implicitly parenthesized as (x.f).g. (не€вно)
She implicitly suggested that he was responsible for the error (безоговорочно)
Such analysis may indicate more than one viable candidate, but we can often discard several inferior algorithms in the process

Strictly speaking, we should precisely define the instructions of the RAM model and their costs. To do so, however, would be tedious [тидиос] (too long and boring) and would yield (bring) little insight (understanding) into algorithm design and analysis. Yet we must be careful not to abuse the RAM model.

Robert's expression had obviously convinced her of his innocence
The judge abused his power by imposing the fines
He is endeavoring to help the Third World (try hard to do or achieve something)
her dexterity with chopsticks
The company has evolved into a major chemical manufacturer (develop, expand)
This notation is more concise (brief) and more easily manipulated
The scope of average-case analysis is limited, because it may not be apparent (obvious) what constitutes (compose) an УaverageФ input for a particular problem
The worst-case running time of the algorithm is theta ['thиита] of n-squared
Immediately, a sentinel standing guard near the jail confronted him
Her hands were coarsened by outside work
Thus, it makes sense to coarsen the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small.
They were apt to exaggerate any aches and pains
O(g(n)) is pronounced Уbig-oh of g of nФ or sometimes just Уoh of g of nФ
In other words, the right-hand side of an equation provides a coarser level of detail than the left-hand side
It takes as input an array of numbers, and it determines the contiguous (adjacent) subarray whose values have the greatest sum
Technicalities in recurrences
Like the chemicals the company produces, the stock price of the Volatile Chemical Corporation is rather volatile (unstable)
It returns a tuple containing the indices demarcating a maximum subarray that crosses the midpoint, along with the sum of the values in a maximum subarray
The key to StrassenТs method is to make the recursion tree slightly less bushy 
Although indicator random variables may seem cumbersome for an application such as counting the expected number of heads on a flip of a single coin, they are useful for analyzing situations in which we perform repeated random trials
We shall use indicator random variables throughout this book
Translating an algorithm for sorting numbers into a program for sorting records is conceptually straightforward, although in a given engineering situation other subtleties may make the actual programming task a challenge
Sometimes an application inherently needs to sort information
Many engineering issues come to the fore when implementing sorting algorithms.
If two nodes have the same parent, they are siblings
She wore a sloppy sweater and jeans

PARTITION always selects an element x as a pivot element around which to partition the subarray
For these angles, the contradiction used to prove the corollary does not arise
